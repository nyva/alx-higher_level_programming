# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Import Modules

Welcome to the ALX Higher Level Programming repository for the Python Import Modules project. This project focuses on various aspects of working with import modules in Python, including importing functions from files, handling command line arguments, and more.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [Command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)
- [Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without assistance:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs


## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Line Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **First Line**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length**: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks: Python Import Modules

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various aspects of working with import modules. The scripts cover topics such as importing functions from files, handling command line arguments, preventing code execution when imported, and performing basic operations.

## Files and Explanations

### 0-add.py

This script imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the result of adding two numbers.

### 1-calculation.py

This script imports functions from `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

### 2-args.py

This script prints the number of arguments passed and lists their values.

### 3-infinite_add.py

This script calculates the sum of all arguments passed to it.

### 4-hidden_discovery.py

This script prints all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### 5-variable_load.py

This script imports a variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

### 100-my_calculator.py

This script imports all functions from `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations based on user input.

### 101-easy_print.py

This script prints "#pythoniscool" using a maximum of 2 lines.

### 102-magic_calculation.py

This script defines a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that performs the same operations as the given Python bytecode.

### 103-fast_alphabet.py

This script prints the uppercase alphabet in a single line.

## Conclusion

These Python scripts provide practical examples of using import modules in various scenarios, showcasing different functionalities and techniques. They serve as useful learning resources for understanding and mastering Python import modules.
